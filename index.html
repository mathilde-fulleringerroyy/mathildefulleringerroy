  		Let me introduce myself, I come from the East of France 🇫🇷, from Alsace to be more precise. I'm a 21 years old student of ESSEC👩🏻‍🎓, this course is my last one before I finish my studies. I hope it will allow me to master the code. I like digital even if it's rather travel, reading and hiking that make me vibrate. Currently, I live in Reunion Island🏔for a communication internship in a media called CANAL +.

				<h2>Travelling ✈️🌍

				<p>
					Traveling is more than a passion for me: it's a way of life. Discovering new cultures, new people, new places is for me a need. For me, lame travel is to challenge myself constantly, to go beyond my limits and learn to adapt to my environment. Which trip was the most exotic? The month of volunteering in India in Kolkata. The one that marked me the most? My Erasmus in Madrid. My next trip? Mexico.

			<h3>Reading 📚
				<i class="fas fa-book-open"></i>

			<p> 
				I have always been an avid reader. Even when I was a little girl, I read everything I could get my hands on. From detective novels to fashion magazines, everything was an excuse to read. I love this intimate moment with my imagination. In addition, I am also fascinated by the power of words and the importance of using them correctly.

				<h4>Hiking⛰⛺️
					<i class="fas fa-hiking"></i> 
				</h4>

				<p>
				 I started hiking by chance, with some friends around Madrid. The meeting was a way for me to hike frequently. Today I hike every weekend, often for two days, sleeping on site. I discovered a privileged contact with nature and all the magnificent landscapes that it offers us. Here, we go from ponds to mountains, and the landscapes are so varied that I feel like I'm traveling to different places with each walk.
